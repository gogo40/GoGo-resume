I am computer scientist with Advanced Resources and Risk Technology, LLC with expertise in computer distributed systems (C++ and Python), geostatistics and physics simulation. 

I have a Computer engineering's bachelor degree and a Electric engineering's master degree from UFPA (Universidade Federal do Pará - Federal University of Pará).  I am currently concluding my PhD degree in Computational Geostatistics at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.   I participated in three International Collegiate Programming Contest national finals (south america/Brazil).

Since 2008, I'm working with project and development of GUIs using Qt, distributed programming in C++, algorithm design and compiler development. And, since 2013, I work with Python.

Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PhD in Computational Geostatistics at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, *2016* - 2019 (expected)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My PhD research project is focused on machine learning applied to computational geostatistics. The main goal is adapt the machine learning tools to create a new generation of geostatistic algorithms and workflows. Thesis defense is planned to September/2019.


Electric Engineering's Master degree in Computational Eletromagnetism at Universidade Federal do Pará, *2011* - 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created a *meshless* simulator for computational eletromagnetism based on RPIM (Radial Point Interpolation Method).


Computer Engineering bachelor at the Universidade Federal do Pará, *2006* - 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I participated in three International Collegiate Programming Contest national finals (south america/Brazil).
